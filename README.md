MATLAB code to create a visual representation of satellite tracks and the solution to the GPS receiver position location. Allows input of a receiver position calculated by correcting GPS satellite pseudoranges using atmospheric corrections (ionospheric and tropospheric) and clock error adjustments. Then, it shows a visual representation of this solution by correcting satellite pseudorange to the shortest distance between satellite and receiver position. Satellites are represented by triangles positioned at their exact x, y, z location above Earth. This code shows satellite positions at every hour on the hour of a given day, which are exported as .pdf files. These can then be made into an animation.
